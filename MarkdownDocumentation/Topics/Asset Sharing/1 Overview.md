Asset Sharing
=============

Asset sharing is a feature that allows game developers to share certain game assets with their modders easily without requiring the asset to be provided in raw form. Any shared assets will be built into Unity asset bundles and then exported in the mod tools package that you will distribute to your modders. Using the game assets window, modders will then be able to view and place these moddable assets in custom scenes to create new levels for your game, without needing to recreate common assets that already exist in the game. These shared game assets will be non-functional to the modder, so any scripts attached will be removed ahead of time so that no behaviour is provided. They will simply act as visual representations of the game asset that the modder can position and rotate as required. 

When a user comes to build a mod that uses shared assets, the Ultimate Modding Toolkit build engine will process all of these assets in all included scenes. As part of this processing, the visual representation of the asset will be destroyed and removed from the scene completely, leaving only a transform component and asset guid reference as a marker. This means that the game content does not need to be built into the mod which would be a waste of storage resources. We can simply store a guid identifier which will relink to the correct game asset at runtime when the mod scene is loaded.
