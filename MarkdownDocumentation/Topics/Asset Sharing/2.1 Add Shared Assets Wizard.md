Asset Sharing Using Mod Tools Builder Wizard   
============================================

The mod tools builder wizard is a GUI tool that you can use to create a mod tools package for your game. Any customizable option relating to the mod tools package can usually be found in this wizard. You can access the wizard window at any time from the following menu:

`Tools -> Ultimate Modding Toolkit -> Mod Tools Builder`

Shared assets have a dedicated section in the mod tools builder wizard and can be found on the `Content` page, under the `Asset Sharing` tab. This tab may not be accessible if you have not provided valid information in one of the earlier pages. See the Mod Tools Builder section for more details.

The main aspect of the asset sharing tab is the tree view folder structure which mirrors your project layout and displays assets that are supported for asset sharing. You will use this tree view to browse and select any assets that you would like to include as shared assets. 

You can expand the drop down displayed next to folder names to view content within them. To include an asset in the mod tools package, simply tick the check box next to the asset name, and it will be built into the mod tools package as a shared asset. You can also tick or untick folders to quickly and easily select a large number of assets to include.

Once you have selected a number of shared assets to include, you can close the window or continue and your selections will be saved inside the project. You can also build a mod tools package via code and these shared asset selections will be detected unless you explicitly provide a different build configuration.
