Asset Sharing Using Mod Tools Builder Wizard   
============================================

The mod tools builder wizard is a GUI tool that you can use to create a mod tools package for your game. Any customizable option relating to the mod tools package can usually be found in this wizard. You can access the wizard window at any time from the following menu:

`Tools -> Ultimate Modding Toolkit -> Mod Tools Builder`

Shared assets have a dedicated section in the mod tools builder wizard and can be found on the `Content` page, under the `Asset Sharing` tab. This tab may not be accessible if you have not provided valid information in one of the earlier pages. See the Mod Tools Builder section for more details.
