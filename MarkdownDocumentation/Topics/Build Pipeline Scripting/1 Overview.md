Build Pipeline Scripting
========================

Ultimate Modding Toolkit includes a standalone build API and serve that is used to create mod packages from content located in a Unity project. This service is commonly referred to as the build engine and it has its own scripting API that you can use from custom editor scripts. The API allows full control for building mods completely from editor script, bypassing the included Ultimate Modding Toolkit Exporter suite of tools. As a result, it is possible to provide your own editor windows and tools that modders can use to export mods for you game. You can also simply hook into the build process using build scripts to customize the generated mods.
