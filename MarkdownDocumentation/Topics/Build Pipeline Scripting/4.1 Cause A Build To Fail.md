Cause a build to fail
=====================

A simple use case that might come up often would be to cause a build to fail. You might choose to fail a build for a number of reasons such as the user has not filled out a required configuration asset for example. To fail a build simply use the following method with a suitable error message:

```cs
buildContext.FailBuild(“Error message here!");
```
