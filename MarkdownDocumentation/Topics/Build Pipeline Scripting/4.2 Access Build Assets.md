Access Build Assets
===================

The build engine will collect and register build assets towards the start of the build. These assets will then be stored in the build context where you can have access to examine, modify, exclude assets and much more. Use the following to access build assets which is a collection of `UltimateModdingToolkit.BuildPipeline.Build.BuildPipelineAsset`:

```cs
BuildPipelineAssets assetsInBuild = context.BuildAssets;

foreach(BuildPipelineAsset asset in assetsInBuild.EnumerateAllAssets(false))
    Debug.Log(asset.AssetRelativePath);
```

> **_NOTE:_** _You can use the API to load any build pipeline asset which will return a `UnityEngine.Object`. At this point, you can then use any Unity engine or editor API to modify the asset as you would normally._

> **_NOTE:_** _Scripts and assemblies are not added to this collection._
