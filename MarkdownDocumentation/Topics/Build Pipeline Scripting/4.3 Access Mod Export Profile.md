Access the Mod Export Profile
=============================

A mod export profile is used to store much of the required mod metadata such as mod name and version, as well as many more optional values such as author, description, icon, etc. Generally, the modder will fill out much of this information before starting a build using the Ultimate Modding Toolkit Exporter tools. You can access this information at build time if required using the following:

```cs
ModExportProfile profile = context.ExportProfile;

Debug.Log(profile.ModName);
Debug.Log(profile.ModAuthor);
Debug.Log(profile.ModVersion);
Debug.Log(profile.ModDescription);
Debug.Log(profile.ModAssetsPath); // Source location of content to include in the mod
Debug.Log(profile.ModExportPath); // Final save location of the built mod
Debug.Log(profile.ModIcon);

Debug.Log("Valid = " + profile.ValidateRequiredValues());
```
